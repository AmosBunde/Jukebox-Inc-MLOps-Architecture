# Jukebox Inc MLOps Architecture Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for Jukebox Inc's MLOps architecture, showcasing the comprehensive machine learning infrastructure design for a modern music platform operating across Africa.

## Overview

Jukebox Inc is revolutionizing the music industry by bringing internet-connected jukeboxes to bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues across Africa. With 1 million jukeboxes installed across 10 countries, serving a population of 400 million people, the platform requires a robust MLOps infrastructure to support various machine learning applications.

## Key ML Applications

1. **Credit Risk Assessment**
   - Predicts customer payment default likelihood
   - Uses historical payment data and behavior patterns
   - Batch inference system with daily updates

2. **Music Recommendations**
   - Real-time recommendation engine
   - Combines collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
   - Personalizes music selection based on venue preferences

3. **Fraud Detection**
   - Real-time anomaly detection
   - Monitors sales patterns and device usage
   - Ensures legitimate device locations and usage reporting

4. **License Optimization**
   - Weekly batch processing for license decisions
   - Analyzes usage patterns and popularity trends
   - Optimizes music library refresh cycles

## Architecture Components
![Proposed Workflows](https://github.com/AmosBunde/Jukebox-Inc-MLOps-Architecture/blob/main/JunkInc%20Data%20Architecture.svg)

### Data Pipeline & Infrastructure
- Event-driven streaming using Apache Kafka: 
- Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium
- Delta Lake for data storage and versioning
- Apache Airflow for orchestration

### Model Lifecycle Management
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Feast for feature store management
- Kubernetes for model serving
- Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring

## Architecture Workflow
# 1. Data Ingestion (CDC with Debezium & Apache Kafka)

### **Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium**
- Monitors changes in source databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and streams them in real-time.
- Ensures that new, updated, or deleted records are continuously captured.

### **Apache Kafka**
- Acts as the central messaging hub for streaming real-time changes from Debezium to downstream components.
- Kafka topics help decouple ingestion from processing and storage, allowing multiple consumers to process data in parallel.

### **How It Helps in MLOps**
- Ensures that the latest data is always available for machine learning pipelines.
- Provides a **scalable and fault-tolerant** data ingestion mechanism.

---

# 2. Data Storage & Processing (Apache Airflow & Delta Lake)

### **Apache Airflow**
- Orchestrates data pipelines, scheduling and managing batch or near-real-time workflows.
- Moves data from Kafka to Delta Lake while performing transformations, validation, and feature extraction.

### **Delta Lake**
- A **structured data lake** that provides **ACID transactions**, **schema enforcement**, and **time travel** (versioning).
- Ensures that raw and processed data is efficiently stored and managed.

### **How It Helps in MLOps**
- Provides **data consistency, reliability, and lineage tracking**, which is critical for model reproducibility.
- Allows ML pipelines to use historical data snapshots for training and validation.

---

# 3. Model Lifecycle Management (MLflow & Feast)

### **MLflow**
- Manages the lifecycle of ML models, including **experiment tracking, model versioning, and reproducibility**.
- Helps compare model performance across different experiments and select the best one for deployment.

### **Feast (Feature Store)**
- Stores precomputed features that are used by ML models during training and inference.
- Ensures **consistency** between features used for training and those used for real-time predictions.

### **How It Helps in MLOps**
- Enables **model governance and reproducibility**, ensuring that teams can track changes and manage experiments.
- Reduces **training-inference skew** by ensuring that feature transformations remain the same in both training and production.

---

# 4. Model Serving (Kubernetes)

### **Kubernetes**
- Deploys ML models as **containerized microservices**.
- Provides **scalability, auto-recovery, and load balancing** to handle multiple inference requests.

### **How It Helps in MLOps**
- Ensures that ML models run **efficiently in production environments**.
- Supports **rolling updates, rollback mechanisms, and multi-version deployments**.

---

# 5. Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)

### **Prometheus**
- Collects system metrics (**CPU, memory, inference latency, request rates**).
- Monitors **model performance** (drift detection, feature skew).

### **Grafana**
- Provides **real-time visualization dashboards**.
- Helps track **model health, API latency, and operational metrics**.

### **How It Helps in MLOps**
- Ensures that models perform **optimally in production** and detect **concept drift**.
- Allows **proactive alerting and troubleshooting** for infrastructure and model failures.

---

# Implementation & Benefits in MLOps

### **End-to-End Automation**
- Automates **data ingestion, storage, feature engineering, model training, deployment, and monitoring**.

### **Scalability & Flexibility**
- Uses **containerized deployment (Kubernetes)** and **real-time streaming (Kafka)** to support large-scale ML workloads.

### **Model Reproducibility & Governance**
- **MLflow & Feast ensure model traceability**, while **Delta Lake provides data lineage**.

### **Improved Monitoring & Observability**
- **Prometheus & Grafana** help detect **model drift, anomalies, and system failures** in real time.

This **MLOps architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and automated workflow for machine learning in production** ðŸš€.
